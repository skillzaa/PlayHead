# PlayHead

> PlayHead is a very simple and small **counter** utility with *play* , *pause* and *stop* function. At any give time the lapsed time can be obtained from *time* function. 

- The main purpose of making this module is for educational purposes. I will maintain this completely but without adding any more functionalities.
- It has no dependencies.
- The lapsed time is returned in milli seconds.
